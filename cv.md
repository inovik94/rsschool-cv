### My career

  I started my career as a system administrator and a technical specialist at the TNT Rock Club, also I made visual content as a motion designer.
Continued my career at the [Aesthetics of Sound](estetikazvuka.com) agency where I was involved in project management of projects such as research and development 
of UI sounds and Audio DNA for [Yandex products](https://estetikazvuka.com/projects/jandeks-muzyka). 
At the same time, while freelancing, I made several projects for the development of [web-sites on WordPress](http://nashanafta.com/), 
created and programmed several [interactive installations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18uBfagLftPQQkIwHqETxhFHNZSEXve6y/view?usp=sharing) in TouchDesigner & Python. 
Recently, I became interested in neural networks and machine learning, made the ["Portrait of a Protester"](https://portraitofprotesters.github.io/v/) project, 
where I applied the latest neural network tools to find an averaged face of Belarusians.



#### Example of Code from my last project:

    def generate_final_image(latent_vector):
        latent_vector = latent_vector.reshape((1, 18, 512))
        generator.set_dlatents(latent_vector)
        img_array = generator.generate_images()[0]
        img = PIL.Image.fromarray(img_array, 'RGB')
        img.save("face.png")
        return img
